I am currently working at Pivotree as a Site Reliability Engineer based in Toronto. As a part of their Cloud Platform Engineering Team I primarily work on Amazon Web Services and Terraform building scalable cloud infrastructure for multiple Fortune 1000 E-Commerce clients in North America and Europe. Before joining Pivotree I was working for a NewYork based financial services company - TIAA and prior to that I worked as a consultant for Cisco where it all started.
